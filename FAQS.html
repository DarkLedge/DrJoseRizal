		<h2>Why did Rizal leave Japan when he was happy in that beautiful country and was in loved with a pretty Japanese girl?</h2>
		<p style="font-size:18px; text-indent:30px;">There is no doubt that Rizal and O-sei-san were deeply in love. If Rizal were a man without patriotism and without self-control, he would have stayed permanently in Japan. He could have married beautiful O-sei-san and lived happily with her. He could have a good life in Japan, for the Spanish legation offered him a job with a high salary. But he was dedicated to a noble mission - the welfare and freedom of his oppressed people. And nothing, even the love of the pretty girl and a good job could make him forgets his mission in life.</p>
