On Feb. 18,1888, Rizal arrived in Yokahoma and registered at the grand Tokyo Hotel. He proceeded the next day to Tokyo Hotel where he was billeted from March 2 to 7, and then transferred to the Spanish Legation.

		<h2>Rizal Monument in Madrid,Spain</h2>
		<p style="font-size:12px; text-indent:30px;">Rizal stayed in Madrid for most of his European sojourn, from 1882 to 1891.

He arrived in Madrid for the first time in May 1882 after his medical studies at University of Santo Tomas.

In his diary, he wrote: “Madrid is one of the pleasant cities of the world; it partakes at the same time of the spirit of Europe and of the Orient.”

He did literary, artistic and patriotic pursuits, despite the many attractions and joyous sounds of Madrid.

A statue of the Philippine martyr and national hero stands in a prominent, well-traveled part of the Spanish capital.</p>
