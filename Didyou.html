	<h1>Did You Know...?</h1>
	<p style ="font-family:courier; text-align:center;">Did you know that three of the animal species we know today were actually named after Rizal?</p>
	<p style ="font-family:courier; text-align:justify; text-indent:30px;">When he was an exile in Dapitan, he collected different kinds of species of animals.  Among them were the Draco Rizali (Wandolleck), a specie of flying dragon, Rachophorous Rizali (Boetger), a hitherto unknown specie of toad and Apogonia Rizali (Heller), a small beetle, which were later named after him.
